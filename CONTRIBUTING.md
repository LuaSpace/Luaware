# Development Conventions
Since this project is written in C++ we need you to be specific cuz C++ sucks ass in literally every aspect. This means:

1. No vague names
2. Be clear and consice with the code, using comments if needed
3. Test your code before pull requests/deployment
4. I swear to God, no memory leaks. 
5. Use different classes for different types
6. Don't forget the one missing semicolon that makes you read your code for 3 hours before realizing that you have a missing semicolon on line 4.
